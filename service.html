            we held a clinic for kids in the community, teaching young kids the basics of tennis. Another event I volunteered for was a 
          community doubles tournament that was also sponsored by our team. I helped set up and manage a local doubles tournaments, played by members of the community.
        I volunteered for a total of 4 years for Viper Tennis!</p>

            I have been given many oppurtunities and mentorship throughout as well. Because of this, I know it is only right to give back what I have been
          so fortunate to receive throughout my life. I plan on starting a program to help children without access to computers and internet, an oppurtunity to do so. Whether this is throug
        fundraising and setting up wireless networks in uncovered areas in the US, or providing computers to children. I along with other know that computers are the future, and all children should be able to have
      access to them, and I believe it would change those kids lives for the better.</p>
