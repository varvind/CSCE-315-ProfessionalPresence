              I primarily worked on one of the main internal and external software tools called Sound Clear Studio. This is a web based desktop Application
              written in Java (JavaFX framework) that interfaces with silicon that the companies produce. This is important for our customers to tune and use our
              devices to their specific needs. 
              <br><br> I specifically worked on features and bug fixes for the project. Outside of coding itself, I worked on an agile based scrum team
              of 8 members, and attended daily standups, sprint reviews and backlog refinements (used Atlassian Jira and Confluence). The project also had a full CI/CD platform using Jenkins. Along with Sound Clear
              Studio, I worked on an internal python script that that used the Jira/Confluence REST API to query how many hours my coworkers logged, and emailed them if they did not
              reach a certain threshold. I also had to write a Jenkins pipeline script that schedules this script to run on certain days.
