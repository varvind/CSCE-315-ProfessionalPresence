          <p> <b>I absolutely love to code. </b> Ever since my sophomore year of high school when I made a small bug move across the screen, 
            I knew this is what I want to do. I started my coding journey not really knowing what discipline I should focus on, 
            so I dipped my feet into many areas of development. 
            I started first with basic <b>HTML and CSS</b>, taking an online course for it, and this is all while learning Java at school. 
            I also messed with <b>IOS development with swift</b> during this time. <br><br>
            I then started thinking to myself about how I can apply these new skills to solve an issue or problem. 
            I knew coding was fun, but I wanted to see if I could actually help people with it. This is when I decided to create my first app. 
            Although it was a simple physics calculator to make homework go faster for me and my friends, it was my first taste and making a product. 
            I learned the hard way that coding is definitely not the hard part, but none the less I ended up getting 80 downloads for the app.
             <br><br>Moving into college is where I really started to hone my skills, mainly on the data structures side of things, all of which through learning <b>C++</b>. 
             I also started a project on my own that would further develop my skills in product development. 
             It all started with a problem I had where clubs and organizations on campus were super difficult to come by, 
             so I decided to create a web application with a friend to combat this. 
             I learned software lifecycle principles, such as <b>project management, CI/CD, and git version control</b>, along with <b>NodeJS, MongoDB and ExpressJS</b>. <br><br>My most recent and largest chunk
             of experience came from my summer internship at <b>Cirrus Logic</b>. I learned what it takes to be a real software engineer. To my surprise, its not about coding all day, but how to solve big
             issues and how to work with a team. Coding has been an integral part of how I problem-solve, and it has taught me that even the biggest issues that we face can be tackled with discipline and hard work. 
             I can't wait to see where this brick road takes me! For more details about the work I've done, feel free to just scroll down!</p>
